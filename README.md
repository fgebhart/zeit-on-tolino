# zeit-on-tolino
Service to auto-upload the ZEIT 🗞 e-paper to your tolino cloud library 📚

This service is similar to
* https://github.com/patrickvogel/zeit-on-tolino
* https://github.com/mlux86/zeit-to-tolino
* https://github.com/Maximilian5189/zeit-to-tolino
with the main difference that this service is designed to be automated using github actions. By using
a Github actions workflow for automating the down- and upload of the e-paper you don't have to worry
about the runtime environment of the scripts. See installation instructions below.
